    bin/rails server

### API Endpoints
    POST   /api/v1/auth                                  Create JWT token
    POST   /api/v1/users/:user_id/contracts              Creates new contract for associated user
    GET    /api/v1/users/:user_id/contracts/:id          Shows specified contract for associated user
    DELETE /api/v1/users/:user_id/contracts/:id          Deletes the specified contract for associated user
    POST   /api/v1/users                                 Creates a user

### User
Create a user by sending a post request with parameters to:

    POST /api/v1/users  
    email = 'test@test.com'
    password = '123456'

### Authentication
Once a user has been created, attain a JWT token by sending a post request to :

    POST /api/v1/auth
    email = 'test@test.com'
    password = '123456'

### Contract management
Once a JWT is given, place the JWT token in the request headers and then send a post request to:

    POST   /api/v1/users/:user_id/contracts
    contract[:vendor] = 'Lebara'
    contract[:starts_on] = '20/12/2018'     'DD/MM/YYYY' format
    contract[:ends_on] = '20/06/2019'       'DD/MM/YYYY' format
    contract[:price] = '35'
